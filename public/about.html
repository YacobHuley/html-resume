<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After being a singer-songwriter for three decades, and a film and television actor for nearly as long,
  I began to feel the need to further my education. Also, with the presidential campaign of 2016, regardless
  of anybody's political stance and tribe, I became aware that nothing was stable, and that I was ignorant of
  the most important issues of our age. So, I began to research everything from global existential threats, to
  world history, and also how our rapid technological advances may affect our futures.</p>

<p>So, I began to study things like data analysis and coding on my own. Primarily, just to gain some level of
  literacy in these fields, but also to see if it might be possible to design more purposeful, fulfilling and
  civil platforms, such as social network apps and alternate websites, to see if we can attract those users who
  are tired of their data and patterns being sold and exploited, and their time being pimped to the highest bidder.
</p>

<p>So far, I have designed little, but reimagined much. I am building this portfolio as part of an online
  course, one that I hope isn't as broken as the others I have attempted, as a way to gay both my own
  potential as a web developer, and teh potential of web development itself to redirect human behavior.

  My hobbies include reading books and listening to podcasts on the subjects of political science, behavioral economics,
  history, neuroscience, rhetoric, artificial intelligence, existential threats, finance, self-improvement, and social
  science
  in general, as well as watching documentaries, foreign and independent movies. I teach acting and I'm working on a
  full
  method. I'm learning French. ABL - Always Be Learning.
