    <h1>Jack Erdie's Resume</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The final objective of my last seven years of self-inflicted study of behavioral economics,
        <br />social psychology, the attention economy and web development will be to build
        <br />more purposeful and fulfilling games and social networking apps. I also intend to apply
        <br />what I have learned, and am learning, to nudge users toward my video and podcasting
        <br />content, as well as to nudge them with that content toward more civil and aspirational
        <br />engagement.
